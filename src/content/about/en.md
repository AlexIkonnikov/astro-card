Frontend developer who builds web and mobile applications with React, React Native, and TypeScript. I enjoy creating user-friendly and performant interfaces, and keeping the code clean and understandable.

<!-- In addition to typical frontend tasks, I have also worked with CI/CD and have basic knowledge of Node.js. I am constantly learning new technologies and looking for ways to make applications faster, more user-friendly, and more reliable.

I love tackling complex challenges because they make development more interesting. -->
